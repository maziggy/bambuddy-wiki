# Failure Analysis

The Failure Analysis feature helps you identify patterns in print failures, correlating failures with conditions like filament type, printer, and time of day.

## Overview

- **Failure rate tracking** — Monitor your overall success rate
- **Pattern detection** — Identify common failure conditions
- **Trend visualization** — Track improvements over time
- **Actionable insights** — Data-driven troubleshooting

## Dashboard Widget

The Failure Analysis widget on the Dashboard shows:

### Failure Rate
- **Green** (< 10%) — Excellent success rate
- **Yellow** (10-20%) — Room for improvement
- **Red** (> 20%) — Needs attention

### Top Failure Reasons
Common failure reasons from your archives:
- Adhesion failure
- Spaghetti / layer shift
- Clogged nozzle
- Filament runout
- Power loss
- User cancelled

### Weekly Trend
A bar chart showing failure rates over the past weeks, helping you track whether changes improve reliability.

## Recording Failures

When a print fails:

1. The archive is automatically marked with status "failed"
2. Edit the archive to add a failure reason
3. Add notes about conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.)

## Analyzing Patterns

The failure analysis correlates failures with:

| Factor | What it reveals |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Filament Type** | Which materials fail most often |
| **Printer** | Printers needing maintenance |
| **Time of Day** | Overnight print reliability |
| **Designer** | Model quality from different sources |

## Using the Data

### High failure rate with specific filament
- Check storage conditions (humidity)
- Verify temperature settings
- Consider different brand/batch

### High failure rate on specific printer
- Schedule maintenance
- Check nozzle wear
- Inspect bed adhesion

### High failure rate at certain times
- Check environmental factors (temperature swings)
- Review overnight monitoring
- Consider scheduling changes

## Tips

- Always record failure reasons for better analysis
- Add detailed notes about conditions
- Review trends monthly
- Use data to prioritize maintenance
- Compare before/after maintenance metrics
