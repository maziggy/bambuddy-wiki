# Projects

Projects allow you to group related prints together, making it easy to track progress on multi-part builds like a Voron printer or cosplay armor set.

## Overview

- **Group prints** — Organize archives into logical projects
- **Track progress** — Set target counts and monitor completion percentage
- **Visual organization** — Color-coded badges and thumbnail previews
- **Flexible assignment** — Add archives via context menu or edit modal

## Creating a Project

1. Navigate to **Projects** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Project**
3. Fill in the project details:
   - **Name** — Project title (e.g., "Voron 2.4 Build")
   - **Description** — Optional notes about the project
   - **Color** — Choose a color for visual identification
   - **Target Count** — Number of prints needed to complete (optional)
4. Click **Create**

## Project Status

Projects can have three statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Active** | Currently in progress |
| **Completed** | All target prints finished |
| **Archived** | No longer active, kept for reference |

## Assigning Archives to Projects

### Via Context Menu

1. Right-click on any archive card
2. Hover over **Add to Project**
3. Select the project from the submenu
4. The archive is now assigned to that project

### Via Edit Modal

1. Click the edit icon on an archive card (or right-click → Edit)
2. Use the **Project** dropdown to select a project
3. Click **Save**

## Project Cards

Each project card displays:

- **Project name** with color indicator
- **Progress bar** (if target count is set)
- **Archive thumbnails** — Click to view the archive
- **Archive count** — Total prints in the project
- **Queue count** — Items in queue for this project

## Project Badges on Archives

Archives assigned to a project display a colored badge with the project name. This helps you quickly identify which project an archive belongs to when browsing the Archives page.

## Removing Archives from Projects

1. Right-click on the archive
2. Hover over **Add to Project**
3. Click **Remove from Project**

Or use the Edit modal and set the Project dropdown to empty.

## Filtering Projects

Use the status filter on the Projects page to show:
- **Active** — Projects currently in progress
- **Completed** — Finished projects
- **Archived** — Inactive projects
- **All** — All projects regardless of status

## Tips

- Use descriptive names that include the project type (e.g., "Voron 2.4 #2" for your second build)
- Set target counts for multi-part prints to track completion percentage
- Archive completed projects to keep them for reference without cluttering your active list
- Color-code projects by category (e.g., red for urgent, blue for personal, green for client work)
